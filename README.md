# Cyclistic Data Analysis

## Understanding the scenario

As a junior data analyst who works on the team of marketing analysts at Cyclistic, a bicycle sharing company in Chicago, the marketing director believes that the future success of the company depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand what differences there are in the use of Cyclistic bicycles between occasional cyclists and annual members. Through this knowledge, your team will design a new marketing strategy to turn occasional cyclists into annual members. However, before that, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations; therefore, you must support your proposal with a convincing view of their professional data and visualizations.

## Stakeholders

* **Cyclistic**: A bike-sharing program that includes 5,800 bicycles and 600 stations. Cyclistic stands out for also offering recumbent bicycles, manual tricycles and cargo bikes that offer a more inclusive use of shared bicycles for people with disabilities and cyclists who cannot use a standard two-wheeled bicycle. Most cyclists choose traditional bicycles, about 8% of cyclists use assisted options. Cyclistic users are more likely to use the bicycle for recreation, but about 30% use it to go to work every day.

* **Lily Moreno**: The marketing director and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike sharing program. Campaigns can include email, social networks and other channels.

* **Cyclistic Marketing Data Computational Analysis Team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing and reporting data that help drive Cyclistic's marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have dedicated yourself not only to knowing Cyclistic's mission and business goals, but also to seeing how you can help Cyclistic achieve it, from your position as a junior data analyst.

* **Cyclistic Executive Team**: The executive team, highly detailed, will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

## About Cyclistic

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-sharing offer. Since then, the program has grown to reach a fleet of 5,824 georeferenced and blocked bicycles in a network of 692 stations throughout Chicago. The bicycles can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.

Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy was based on building a general brand recognition and attracting wide consumer segments. One of the approaches that helped make this possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-trip passes, full-day passes and annual memberships. Customers who buy single-trip passes or full-day passes are called occasional cyclists. Customers who buy annual memberships are called Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic financial analysts came to the conclusion that annual members are much more profitable than occasional cyclists. Although price flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Instead of creating a marketing campaign that aims at all new customers, Moreno believes that there are many possibilities to turn casual cyclists into members. She points out that casual cyclists already know the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at turning occasional cyclists into annual members. However, to do that, the team of marketing analysts needs to better understand how annual members and occasional cyclists differ, why casual cyclists would buy a membership and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and his team are interested in analyzing Cyclistic's historical bicycle travel data to identify trends.
